Clarinet allows us to check our project's syntax and semantics. 
You can check if your project's contract(s) contains valid code by running: clarinet check

wallet password 
edge password 
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new contract then navigate to the new directory:

clarinet new clarity-tutorial && cd clarity-tutorial


clarinet check <path/to/file.clar>

//////////
remove # from Clarinet.toml file
////////////////////////

test
clarinet test
If you want to maximize test coverage, you can test your contract's coverage by running the following command:
clarinet test --coverage

clarinet requirements add <contract address>
clarinet contract new <contract name>

clarinet console

Possible Solutions for Cross-Chain Interaction
If you want one token to be from Solana and another to be an SIP-010 token, you would need:

A Cross-Chain Bridge:

For example, a wrapped token system where the Solana token is represented as a wrapped SIP-010 token on the Stacks blockchain.
Custom Logic for Validation:

You could use off-chain services to verify and relay data from Solana and then encode that logic into your Stacks smart contract.
Representing External Tokens:

If you're not planning on using an actual Solana address in your smart contract, you could instead use a custom identifier or metadata to represent the Solana token indirectly.
